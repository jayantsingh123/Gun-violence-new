# Gun-Violence-Incidents
Analysis of Gun Violence Incidents across US states during the period 2013 through 2018. Gun violence has become a grim reality of life in the United States. 
According to data from the Pew Research Center, 44 percent of Americans say that they know someone who has been shot, and another 23 percent report that a gun has 
been used to threaten or intimidate them or a family member. A September 2019 ABC News/Washington Post poll found that 6 in 10 Americans fear that a mass shooting 
will occur in their community. And in a March 2018 USA Today/Ipsos poll, 53 percent of young people between the ages of 13 and 17 identified gun violence as a 
“major worry”—outranking all other concerns listed in the poll.


## Scope of the Project
In the present analysis, we look at Gun Violence data in US during the period 2013 through March 2018. Since we don't have enough data for 2018, we restrict most of 
the analysis to 2017.  Some of the variables included in the dataset are;
* Date and time of the Shooting 
* Location, City, county as well as State information
* Incident characteristics
* Number of suspects as well as victims involved in the incident
* Number as well as type of guns used; stolen gun or unknown guns

This topic is quite broad and can be used to answer lots of queries. The present analysis aims at answering questions related to following aspects of Gun violence;
State with highest count of Gun violence incidents, Death count in various states, Change in Gun violence statistcs across Different States etc.
